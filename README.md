# 02507 Project work within Image Analysis and Computer Graphics

In this project, the goal was to digitally map ranges of picked up frequencies along the cochlea. In order to achieve this, we applied a variaty of image analysis tools and methodologies as to unfold the 3D cochlea into a 2D elongated image. A visualisation of our data and solution can be seen in _02507_Project_work_Presentation.pdf_.
